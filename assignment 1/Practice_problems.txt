1. Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Customer table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. All columns are required (not null).


CREATE TABLE Customer (
	custno      	CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
	custname  	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	address    	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	Internal     	CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
	contact      	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	phone        	INTEGER(8) NOT NULL,
	city            VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	state           CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
	zip             INTEGER(5) NOT NULL,

	CONSTRAINT custnoPK PRIMARY KEY (custno);
)

2 . Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Facility table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. All columns are required (not null).


CREATE TABLE Facility(
	facno       	CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
	facname  	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

	CONSTRAINT 	facnoPK PRIMARY KEY (facno);
)

3. Write a CREATE TABLE statement for the Location table. Choose data types appropriate for the DBMS used in your course. LocName column is required (not null).


CREATE TABLE Location (
	locno	       CHAR(4),
	facno	       CHAR(4).  
	LocName   	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

	CONSTRAINT locnoPK PRIMARY KEY (locno),
	CONSTRAINT facnoFK FOREIGN KEY (facno) REFERENCES Facility;
)



4. Identify the foreign key(s) and 1-M relationship(s) among the Customer, Facility, and Location tables. For each relationship, identify the parent table and the child table.

Foreign key=facno in table Location 
One facility to many locations
Facility is parent to location

5. Extend your CREATE TABLE statement from problem (3) with referential integrity constraints.


CREATE TABLE Location (
	locno	       CHAR(4),
	facno	       CHAR(4).  
	LocName   VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

	CONSTRAINT locnoPK PRIMARY KEY (locno),
	CONSTRAINT facnoFK FOREIGN KEY (facno) REFERENCES Facility (Facno);
)

6. From examination of the sample data and your common understanding of scheduling and operation of events, are null values allowed for the foreign key in the Location table?  Why or why not? Extend the CREATE TABLE statement in problem (5) to enforce the null value restrictions if any.

NO because the basketball team does not want any locker room available, they probably want the one in the basketball stadium. 


7. Extend your CREATE TABLE statement for the Facility table (problem 2) with a unique constraint for FacName. Use an external named constraint clause for the unique constraint.


CREATE TABLE Facility(
	facno   	CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
	facname  	VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

	CONSTRAINT facnoPK PRIMARY KEY (facno),
	CONSTRAINT uniqueFacName UNIQUE (FacName);
)
